# Travel-Agency
Hi there!

In this project I pretended to work in a travel agency in Berlin.

There were 5 places available for Germans from Hamburg, Munich or Berlin to travel.

To register for the trip, the person had to enter the city they live in, name, email and the chosen hotel in Berlin, if that person was not a Berliner.

Among those from Hamburg and Munich who chose a hotel in Berlin, a hotel was randomly chosen and therefore a person who chose that hotel was also randomly chosen to receive a discount.

To organize the data, a list of lists was created. Each sublist referred to a city. To store people's personal data, the "Person" object was created (name, email, city and hotel all inside it).

At the end, all the details of those who are going to travel are shown (name, email and city), including the chosen hotel, if applicable. And for this, a matrix with such data inside it was used.

It is noteworthy that this program aimed to put into practice what I have learned so far in programming. This program is not the simplest way to do what was intended.
